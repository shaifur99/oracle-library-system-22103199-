## 🚀 How to Run

1. *Connect to Oracle Database*
   
   sqlplus username/password@database
   

2. *Execute files in order:*
   
   @sql/setup.sql    -- Creates tables and inserts sample data
   @sql/queries.sql  -- Runs all required queries  
   @sql/plsql.sql   -- Creates procedures, functions, triggers
   @sql/admin.sql   -- Sets up users and indexing
   

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables Created
- *BOOKS* - Book inventory with book_id, title, author, publisher, publication_year, isbn, category, total_copies, available_copies, price
- *MEMBERS* - Member information with member_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, membership_date, membership_type
- *TRANSACTIONS* - Transaction records with transaction_id, member_id, book_id, issue_date, due_date, return_date, fine_amount, status

## 📝 Assignment Requirements

Based on the assignment document, this implementation includes:

### Sample Data Requirements
- 20 books across different categories
- 15 members (students, faculty, staff)  
- 25 transactions (returned, pending, overdue)

### Key Queries Implemented
- Books with available copies less than total copies
- Members with overdue books
- Top 5 most borrowed books
- Members who never returned books on time
- Fine calculations (₹5 per day after due date)

### PL/SQL Components
- *ISSUE_BOOK* procedure with member_id and book_id parameters
- *CALCULATE_FINE* function returning ₹5 per overdue day
- Trigger to update available_copies on book return

### User Management
- *librarian* user: Full access to all tables
- *student_user*: SELECT only on BOOKS table
